# CYK_Algorithm
Implementation of the CYK algorithm to determine whether a given string is in a CFG in CNF. The CYK algorithm is an algorithm that can efficiently decide whether a string can be generated by a CFG in CNF. The algorithm works by using a dynamic programming approach, filling in a matrix to determine if each substring of the input string can be generated by the CFG.
