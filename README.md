# CYK_Algorithm
Implementation of the CYK algorithm to determine whether a given string is in a CFG in CNF. The CYK algorithm is an algorithm that can efficiently decide whether a string can be generated by a CFG in CNF. The algorithm works by using a dynamic programming approach, filling in a matrix to determine if each substring of the input string can be generated by the CFG.

# Usage
To run the program, follow these steps:
1. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory containing the files homework4.py, grammar.txt, and Report.
2. Run the program by typing python3 homework4.py in the terminal.
3. Select one of the 4 questions by typing the full option (e.g. "CNF1").
4. Enter the input string when prompted.
5. The program will output the first column of the CYK table
and indicate whether the input string belongs to the grammar.

#Note
● Make sure the grammar.txt file is in the same directory as the homework4.py file.
● Select the question by typing the full option (e.g. "CNF1") to ensure correct functionality.
